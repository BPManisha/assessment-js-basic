/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const AnalysisAndRequirements ="do the analysis of current(or as is scenario of the existing solution to find out the gap(also called gap analysis). Gather and document the requirements through the requirement meetings with the possible stakeholders "

const design = " prepare a layout of how frontend will look like, how backend will work, how the upstream and down stream applications will be interfaced and document to create a design document."

const Implementation =" once the requirements and design documents are signedoff by stakeholders, it can be explained and shared with developers so the developers team write the code "

Testing & Integration
"once the developers write the code, it will tested(verified and validated against the requiremts as well as for quality.if there are more devopers working and producing results for same product development. the developer's code needs to be combined to see and verify end to end results."
